# Pokedex Test Project

## Instractions to Run application
==> FLutter version: stable 2.8.1
1) Make sure that you are using at least latest version that I have used
2) After opening project on terminal run: "flutter pub get"
3) For setting Android Splash screen I have used flutter_native_splash. So it order to it to rewrite the native splash screen
   on terminal please run: "flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create"
4) Now if you do not have any errors you must be ready to run. Please note that I have tested on IOS version 15.2
   and Android 12 (API 32).
