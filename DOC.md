# Pokedex Test Project

## Instractions to Run application
==> FLutter version: stable 2.8.1
1) Make sure that you are using at least latest version that I have used
2) After opening project on terminal run: "flutter pub get"
3) For setting Android Splash screen I have used flutter_native_splash. So it order to it to rewrite the native splash screen
   on terminal please run: "flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create"
4) Now if you do not have any errors you must be ready to run. Please note that I have tested on IOS version 15.2
   and Android 12 (API 32).
   
## Used libraries with versions:
http: ^0.13.4
flutter_staggered_grid_view: ^0.4.1
cached_network_image: ^3.2.0
provider: ^6.0.2
shared_preferences: ^2.0.11
flutter_native_splash: ^1.3.2

## Code snippets:

1) For capitalization of 1st letters with very small modification code used from here: //https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29628989/how-to-capitalize-the-first-letter-of-a-string-in-dart#:~:text=extension-,StringExtension,-on%20String%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20String
2) For showing dialogs with small modification used the official cookbook example on flutter website.

## Personal Notes:

1) Because in the middle of week it was really hard for me to give time to this projects, I could work only 1-2 hours before bed on 4 week days this week.
   For last weekend I could only work maybe 4-5 hours total. So It was a bit hard to finish. Total of 2-3 full time days I could finish project fully
2) Project fully functional as expected. There are only some things that could not do or had not time to do.
   a) For iOS Splash screen I used native Swift Splash screen (I am also Swift native developer). But for Android I could not do it and used everytime used package: flutter_native_splash,
   It worked parcially (Only background color shows but logo not showing.) Because of time limit now I stopped working to fix it because already wested much time for just splash screen of android.
   2) About unit test. I had not done until now any unit tests personally but I had looked to some unit tests. it is actually very easy. But because now it my last day- hours to submit, I just even did not 
   start unit test works.
3) Very small difference in appBar of main screen and division under it compared to actualy design.

4) This Project was actually in different project. There i had committed many local changes. But because of Android splash screen I have changed very much
   Android files. So basically before sending I just copied my project new project (This project). So it has only 1-2 commit s

5) The most important: it was very cool - very good orginized project. Shortly I loved it. At least I have finished this project)) Thanks,
